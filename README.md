# MonogameLearning
Repository used to store learning progression of monogame. Also to contain other experimentations throughout learning. The purpose of this repository is to help document my learning while also allow others who wish to learn to be able to very easily digest the learning outcomes by using the commit history.

The way this repository is setup is in stages or sections. Each time I try and experiment with something I will create a new project. Each project will contain whatever I am experimenting on at the time. When I move onto another experimentation section or learning objective, I will create a new project and migrate any code over from the previous project that I wish to use again.

While I understand I could use branching and such methods with the repository to achieve similar results, I do this because:
-Makes it easier to snapshot progress = Basically anyone who would like to learn from these projects themselves can see clearly what happened to each project.
-Isolate topics of learning = This method allows a person if they wish to learn something to just grab the project they want to learn something from and focus solely on the new additions in this project relative to the previous one. (Assuming sequential learning steps)
-Can see each project's changes = while it would be possible to see each projects changes by following the commit history, if it was one project constantly evolving then tracing down files and changes becomes tedious. This way, if someone looked at the first commit of a learning objective and stepped through each one of it's commits, they could see how the learning evolved.
-Helps as a diary = Ultimately this also allows the learning to be documented as a diary of learning. The handy thing about this is git allows the learning to be timed and also can let anyone step through to see how the learning progressed. Also helps me be able to retrace steps I have taken with things when I need to remember things.
